Note : This library is still under development and currently does not support a lot of interpolation routines.

Supports the following 1D interpolation routines:
* Linear interpolation
* Cubic spline interpolation

## Usage

See the documentation for detailed examples.

## Roadmap

* Support polynomial interpolation.
* N-dimensional interpolation routines.
* Optional fast data manipulation with NMatrix.
* Easy plotting of results.
* Complete NMatrix integration.
